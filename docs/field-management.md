# Field Management Design

## Goal

Allow field managers to manage games in their fields efficiently.

## Description

The field manager should be able to:

- View all pending game requests for their fields.
- View all accepted games scheduled in their fields.
- Approve or reject pending game requests.
- View a dashboard of game statistics for their field (nice-to-have).
- Potentially set up automatic approval rules (e.g., if a slot is empty).

## Considerations

- When should game requests be sent? After a group is full, or immediately upon game creation? Consider the trade-offs between immediate requests (more management overhead) and delayed requests (potential for slots to fill before approval).
- How to handle conflicts when multiple games request the same time slot?
- How to verify field ownership?

## Requirements

### Backend:

- **Field Manager Role**: Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system to identify and authorize field managers.
- **Field Ownership Request**:
  - API endpoint for users to request ownership of a field.
  - Admin approval process for field ownership requests.
  - Mechanism to associate fields with field managers in the database.
- **Game Request Management**:
  - API endpoints for field managers to approve or reject game requests.
  - Update game status in the database upon approval/rejection.
- **Game Statistics (Nice-to-have)**:
  - API endpoints to retrieve game statistics for a field (e.g., number of games played, average attendance, most popular game type).
- **Automatic Approval (Nice-to-have)**:
  - Implement logic to automatically approve game requests if the requested time slot is available and no conflicts exist.

### Frontend:

- **Field Manager Interface**:
  - Special navbar or dashboard for field managers, providing access to field management features.
  - Display of pending game requests with options to approve or reject.
  - Calendar view of accepted games scheduled in the field.
  - Display of game details (e.g., game type, start time, participants).
- **Request Field Ownership**:
  - Form for users to submit a request to become a field manager.
- **Game Statistics Dashboard (Nice-to-have)**:
  - Visual representation of game statistics for the field.

## Development Roadmap

1.  **Backend Implementation**:
    - Implement field manager role and RBAC.
    - Implement field ownership request and approval process.
    - Implement API endpoints for managing game requests.
2.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    - Create field manager interface with pending requests and scheduled games views.
    - Implement request field ownership form.
    - Implement approve/reject game request functionality.
    - Integrate with backend API endpoints.
3.  **Nice-to-have Features**:
    - Implement game statistics dashboard.
    - Implement automatic approval rules.

## Time Expected

1-2 weeks
